# A small study of interpolation and approximation methods

This library aims to make the exploration of various state-of-the-art interpolation and approximation methods easily
accessible to mathematicians, computer scientists, machine learning practitioners, and others.

We have implemented and tested basic interpolation and approximation methods, such as Least Squares on random grid
points and Sparse Grids using Smolyak's Algorithm. For our tests, we used well-known (in numerical analysis at least)
functions such as the Genz functions. The Function and Fitter API provide an easy way to plug in your own function and
try this library out.

In the following, we provide a short mathematical description of the methods for the interested reader.
